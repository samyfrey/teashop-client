### Planning process and overall strategy
To build this project, I first started with wireframes and identifying user stories. 
I chose React to provide for a smooth front end user experience, loading content quickly and displaying a unified design thanks to components. 
My idea while working with React is to break down my code in a meaningful way and easy to follow/debug, while minimizing the amount of components. 
I regularly went back to my wireframes to keep in mind the user experience and overall structure of my site to avoid getting lost and over-engineering things. In the end, I made sure I was able to achieve my goals as a user, identified in the user stories. 

### Challenges and stretch goals
One of my main challenges is styling, which is what I want to improve going forward. I want to make better use of the various styling libraries out there.
My main stretch goal is to turn the site into an online shop. I also want to learn Redux to avoid losing the sign in when a user reloads the page.
